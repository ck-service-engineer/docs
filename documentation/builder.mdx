## General builder settings:

After creating a blank Companion or creating it from the template, you will see our general page for setting up the Companion. 

On the Top navigation you can see name of Companion that can be changed, Companion id, delete button, sharable demo link button and Save button.

The top navigation displays:

### Chat modes settings

For different Modes setting are slightly different but they have some similar inputs like **Greeting message, Prompt, Companion Resources, Provider** and **Model.** You can specify different values for each of the mode and it will affect only this mode of the Companion.

On the right sidebar we have our in-builder testing widgets. Basically right after making changes and saving settings you can check how Companion speaks and behave. For voice mode it’s gonna be a web call or phone call (number will be your profile number). For SMS you can start text chat or get an SMS and continue speaking with bot via SMS. For Text mode it can be a web chat.

### Integration

On the bottom of the customization settings you can find integration options. There are two options of integration from the builder: widget or iframe.
With widget you can simply copy-paste embed code we provided and widget bubble will appear in right or left bottom corner of your web page. After clicking on Bubble your Companion will appear and you users will be ready to talk with him.

With Iframe things slightly different. You can copy paste embed code on your web page and iframe with Companion will appear. You can build logic of appearance of this iframe by your own or leave it as it is, so iframe will be drawn on page load.

### Advanced settings

Iframe or Widget integration from the box supports anonymous voice communication.

But we support few advanced settings to extend this.

For make chat more personal for users so Companion will remember some facts about user and previous interaction context you can provide `uniqueId` for iframe (`data-unique-id` for widget) so we can identify different end users, save some data and use it in future interaction. Value of this param can be any unique string less than **30 characters.**
