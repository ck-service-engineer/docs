### Chat modes settings

For different Modes setting are slightly different but they have some similar inputs like **Greeting message, Prompt, Companion Resources, Provider** and **Model.** You can specify different values for each of the mode and it will affect only this mode of the Companion.

On the right sidebar we have our in-builder testing widgets. Basically right after making changes and saving settings you can check how Companion speaks and behave. For voice mode it’s gonna be a web call or phone call (number will be your profile number). For SMS you can start text chat or get an SMS and continue speaking with bot via SMS. For Text mode it can be a web chat.
